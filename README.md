# loan_analyzerC1

#The application examines loan data and provides present value of the investments.Using the same present value findction, it also extracts a list of inexpensive loans following with adjustable guidelines(Eg. loan price=<500) and generates a csv file witht this data.

#One of the challenges I faced working this code was organizing the data in a logical fashion that would be easy to read and generate an organized data file(csv).

#In order to run the project pyhton 3.9 is needed.

#This project can be used to anaize large dictionaries of loans and isolating them based on their present value which is useful for the financial desicion process.
